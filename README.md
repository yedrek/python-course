# A first course in Python (in Polish)

This is a first course in the Python language. It is written in Polish, in a set of interactive Jupyter notebooks. Although its scope aims to be introductory, it goes to considerable depth in topics not often discussed in such courses. Its distinguishing features are clear and detailed explanations, as well as hundreds of programming exercises, from simple one-liners up to multi-part programs, most with extensive hints. Its aim has also been to introduce the student to algorithmic thinking, as well as mathematical and logical reasoning used in programming.

## Class Use

There are seven large notebooks.

The numbering of the lessons is somewhat weird, which is an offshoot of how the course was originally taught: there is no "Lesson 1" (it was given by another lecturer, on general ideas around programming), and some notebooks contain double lessons. For class use, we employed the following approach:

- Each notebook was made available to the students some time before the class.

- Then each session was two-hour long (with a short break in the middle), in which the lecturer would discuss the notebook on a large screen, stopping by each short exercise, and giving 1-2 minutes to the students to complete it; then the lecturer would type in and discuss the solution.

- After each class, there were a number of longer programming exercises, which the students had a week to complete, and send to the lecturers for verification. It was stressed that this is a vital part of acquiring the material.

- The next class would start with a short discussion of the homework, and presenting the solutions.

## Personal Use

The course is designed to be used in a class setting the same as for self-teaching. The explanations are extra detailed and attempt to convey an experience of listening to a teacher. There are many exercises, from very simple ones, which warm up the student, to complicated programs; most of the problems come with detailed hints; it is however best not to start with the hinsts, but attempt the solution yourself, only in case of problems referring to the hints.

## To Do

The final lesson, `9-10_Functions.ipynb` is currently being redesigned (but can still be used).
